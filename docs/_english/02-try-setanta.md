## try-setanta.ie

When you go to [try-setanta.ie](https://try-setanta.ie), you will see something like this.

![The first site](/assets/images/teagaisc/teagaisc01.png)

There are three pieces on the site. They are the "stáitse" (stage), the editor and the console.

You can write Setanta programs in the editor. Then when you click the "Tosaigh" (start) button, the program starts running. Then the program can draw shapes on the stage, or write phrases out on the console.

## Example

Type `scríobh('Dia duit')` in the editor like this

**If you don't know how to type "í", you can use "scriobh".**

Now, click on the "Tosaigh" button.

Now look at the console!
